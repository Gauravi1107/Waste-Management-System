# 1.PROBLEM STATEMENT:

People usually segregate waste manually, which often leads to errors, inefficiency and improper disposal
of materials. This leads to increase in the landfill waste, causing environmental pollution and reduces the 
amount of recyclable material recovered.
There is a need for an automated system that can classify the common household items based on their description
and recommend the correct disposal bin.

# 2.SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:

The project focuses on creating a python-based item classification system that:

.Takes user inputs describing multiple items.

.Automatically defines each item's category (e.g., Plastic, Paper, Metal etc).

.It assigns the coorect bin number based on the pre-defined sorting rules.

.Displays appropriate action(Move/Reject).

# 3.TARGET-USERS:

.Households looking for an easy digital tool to classify recyclable waste.

.Developers working on early prototypes of smart waste segregation systems.

.Environmental awareness clubs or school projects.

# 4.HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES: 

.Accepts multiple item descriptions from the user.

.Uses keyword-based classification logic.

.Maps each category to a unique sorting bin.

.Provides clear console output for classification and actions.

.Handles unknown or ambiguous items safely.

.Simple and expandable rule-based logic for future improvements.
